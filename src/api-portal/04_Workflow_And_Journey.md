# Developer API Portal: Workflow & User Journey

This document visualizes the developer's path through the API portal, from initial discovery to successful integration.

## 1. High-Level Developer Workflow

This diagram shows the ideal, end-to-end flow for a developer using the FleetEdge platform.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Discovers FleetEdge Dev Portal] --> B{Browse API<br/>Marketplace};
    B --> C[Selects 'Vehicle Telemetry API'];
    C --> D{Review Docs & Pricing};
    D --> E[Signs up / Logs in];
    E --> F[Subscribes to 'Pro' Plan];
    F --> G[Navigates to Dashboard];
    G --> H[Generates New API Key];
    H --> I{Test in API<br/>Playground};
    I -- Success --> J[Copies code snippet];
    J --> K[Integrates into application];
    K --> L{Monitor Usage<br/>in Dashboard};
    I -- Failure --> M[Reads error message<br/>& retries];
    M --> I;
    L --> N[End: Successful Integration];
```

## 2. Cross-Functional System Touchpoints

A developer's interaction with the API portal doesn't happen in a vacuum. The design must account for the entire lifecycle of an event, from the UI to back-end systems, sales, and support. This diagram shows the journey of a single event, like an API key being created or a rate limit being exceeded.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Developer Portal (UI/CLI)"
        A[1. User Action<br/>(e.g., Generate Key, Exceed Quota)]
    end

    subgraph "Platform Services"
        B[2. API Backend<br/>Logs Event] --> C{3. Billing Service<br/>Checks Plan Limits};
        C --> D[4. Alerting Service<br/>Triggers Webhook/Email]
    end

    subgraph "Business & Support Systems"
        E[5. CRM / Sales Tool<br/>(Notified of high usage trial)]
        F[6. Support Platform<br/>(Ticket created if error persists)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Security & Audit"
        G[7. SIEM / Audit Log<br/>(Action stored for forensics)]
    end

    A --> B;
    D --> A;
    C --> E;
    D --> F;
    B --> G;
```

## 3. Failure Mode Mapping & Service Design

A resilient system is designed with failure in mind. This section maps out potential failures and considers their impact not just on the end-user, but on our internal teams (a service design perspective).

| Potential Failure | User-Facing Impact | Internal (Service Design) Impact | Our Design Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Webhook delivery fails** | Developer's application doesn't receive a critical, time-sensitive event (e.g., `vehicle.emergency_braking`). | ‚Ä¢ **Support Team:** Ticket queue floods with "your webhooks are broken" complaints.<br/>‚Ä¢ **DevRel Team:** Loses credibility with developers. | ‚Ä¢ **Webhook Event Log:** A dashboard view where developers can see a log of all sent webhooks and their delivery status (`Success`, `Failed`, `Pending`).<br/>‚Ä¢ **Automated Retries:** System automatically retries failed deliveries with exponential backoff.<br/>‚Ä¢ **Proactive Alerting:** Alert the user after 3 consecutive failures. |
| **Rate limit breached mid-request** | A critical process (e.g., end-of-day reporting) fails halfway through, leaving data in an inconsistent state. | ‚Ä¢ **Support Team:** Gets complex tickets about data integrity.<br/>‚Ä¢ **Engineering Team:** May need to manually clean up corrupted data. | ‚Ä¢ **"Dry Run" Flag:** For critical endpoints, offer a flag to check if the full request would exceed the rate limit without actually executing it.<br/>‚Ä¢ **Granular Usage Stats:** Allow developers to see usage per key and per endpoint, so they can better forecast their needs. |
| **Onboarding a new API (Internal)** | A new API is added to the platform, but the documentation is incomplete, or the playground isn't configured correctly. | ‚Ä¢ **DevRel & Docs Team:** Scrambles to fix public-facing content post-launch.<br/>‚Ä¢ **Product Team:** Launch is perceived as sloppy. | ‚Ä¢ **API Onboarding Checklist:** A standardized internal process. A new API cannot be made public until it has complete documentation, a configured playground, and passing health checks. This makes the *design system* a part of the *internal service* of launching an API. |

## 4. Alternate Journeys & Entry Points

A developer's journey is not always linear. The design must account for users entering the workflow from different contexts.

*   **The "Docs-First" Journey:**
    *   **Entry Point:** A developer finds a FleetEdge tutorial on a blog or in our official documentation.
    *   **Key UX Feature:** The documentation contains an embedded "Run in Playground" button next to a code example.
    *   **Flow:** Clicking this button deep-links the user directly into the **API Playground** (Screen 2), pre-populating it with the relevant example code. If the user isn't logged in, they are prompted to do so first, and are then seamlessly redirected to the pre-loaded playground.

*   **The "Alert-Driven" Journey:**
    *   **Entry Point:** A developer receives a rate-limiting email alert or a security warning about a key.
    *   **Key UX Feature:** The email contains a direct link to the relevant page.
    *   **Flow:** Clicking "View Usage" in the email takes them directly to the **Developer Dashboard** (Screen 3), with the relevant API usage chart pre-selected. Clicking "Review Key" takes them directly to the key management section.

*   **The "CLI-to-Web" Journey:**
    *   **Entry Point:** A developer gets an error in the CLI.
    *   **Key UX Feature:** The CLI error message contains a URL.
    *   **Flow:** The CLI suggests a URL like `https://portal.fleetedge.com/keys/fe_sk_...xxxx/scopes` to resolve a permission issue. Clicking this link takes the authenticated user directly to the specific key editing UI in the portal.

## 5. Developer User Journey Map

This map details the thoughts, feelings, and pain points of our persona, Alex, at each stage of the workflow.

| Phase | Alex's Goal | Actions | Thoughts & Feelings | Pain Points (Current State) | Opportunities (Our Design) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discovery** | "Does this platform have the data I need?" | ‚Ä¢ Googles "fleet data api"<br/>‚Ä¢ Lands on the FleetEdge marketing page<br/>‚Ä¢ Clicks on "Developers" or "API" link | ü§î "Okay, this looks promising. Is it for real developers or just marketing fluff?"<br/>ü§® "I hope I don't have to talk to a salesperson." | ‚Ä¢ Can't find the developer portal easily.<br/>‚Ä¢ Vague marketing language instead of technical details. | ‚Ä¢ Prominent "Developers" link in the main nav.<br/>‚Ä¢ A clear, compelling value proposition on the landing page. |
| **Consideration** | "Is this API good? Is the price fair?" | ‚Ä¢ Browses the API marketplace<br/>‚Ä¢ Reads the 'Vehicle Telemetry' overview<br/>‚Ä¢ Checks the pricing page | üòé "Nice, a marketplace. This is professional."<br/>üßê "The 'Basic' plan seems limited. Let's see the pricing."<br/>üòí "The current checkout flow is confusing. What are all these parameters?" | ‚Ä¢ Confusing, non-standard checkout flow.<br/>‚Ä¢ Pricing is unclear or requires a quote.<br/>‚Ä¢ No way to see the API quality before committing. | ‚Ä¢ Clean, card-based API marketplace.<br/>‚Ä¢ Interactive pricing page/calculator.<br/>‚Ä¢ Publicly visible, high-quality documentation. |
| **Onboarding** | "Get me an API key, fast." | ‚Ä¢ Signs up for an account<br/>‚Ä¢ Subscribes to a plan<br/>‚Ä¢ Looks for where to generate a key | üöÄ "Great, I can sign up with GitHub. Easy."<br/>üí≥ "Standard credit card form, fine."<br/>üôÑ "Now I have to wait for an email with a password-protected doc? Seriously?" | ‚Ä¢ **Manual API key delivery via email.**<br/>‚Ä¢ Clunky, insecure password sharing.<br/>‚Ä¢ The "Aha!" moment is delayed by hours or days. | ‚Ä¢ **Instant, self-serve API key generation.**<br/>‚Ä¢ Securely display the key once and provide a 'copy' button.<br/>‚Ä¢ Immediately forward the user to the API playground. |
| **Testing & Integration** | "Does this actually work as advertised?" | ‚Ä¢ Opens the API documentation<br/>‚Ä¢ Tries to make a test call (e.g., in Postman)<br/>‚Ä¢ Gets an error<br/>‚Ä¢ Debugs the issue | üò† "Why did my first request fail? The error is cryptic."<br/>ü§î "Let me re-read the docs carefully."<br/>üí° "Ah, the VIN format is different than I expected."<br/>ü•≥ "It works! Now to code." | ‚Ä¢ No built-in testing environment.<br/>‚Ä¢ Documentation is incomplete or has no examples.<br/>‚Ä¢ Vague error messages (`400 Bad Request`). | ‚Ä¢ An **interactive API playground** that makes testing trivial.<br/>‚Ä¢ Rich code examples in multiple languages.<br/>‚Ä¢ Error messages that are specific and helpful. |
| **Usage & Maintenance**| "How much am I using? Are my keys secure?" | ‚Ä¢ Deploys code to production<br/>‚Ä¢ Visits the developer dashboard periodically<br/>‚Ä¢ Updates billing info | üòä "The integration was smoother than I thought."<br/>üìà "Cool, I can see my usage on this chart."<br/>ü§î "I should probably create a new key just for the production environment." | ‚Ä¢ No visibility into API usage.<br/>‚Ä¢ No way to manage keys (rotate, delete).<br/>‚Ä¢ Fear of surprise overage charges. | ‚Ä¢ A clean developer dashboard with usage charts.<br/>‚Ä¢ Proactive alerting for quota limits.<br/>‚Ä¢ Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for API keys. |
