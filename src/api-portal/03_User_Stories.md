# Developer API Portal: Technical User Stories

This document translates the needs of our persona, Alex, into actionable user stories. These stories will guide the design and development of the portal's features.

---

### Epic 1: API Discovery & Onboarding

*Goal: Allow developers to easily find, understand, and get started with our APIs.*

1.  **As Alex**, I want to browse a marketplace of available APIs so I can see the different data products FleetEdge offers.
2.  **As Alex**, I want to see clear, simple pricing tiers for each API so I can understand the cost and choose a plan that fits my budget.
3.  **As Alex**, I want to read a high-level overview of an API's capabilities on the marketplace page so I don't have to read the full documentation just to understand what it does.
4.  **As Alex**, I want a simple, developer-friendly sign-up process so I can get into the portal quickly. (e.g., "Sign up with GitHub").
5.  **As Alex**, I want to be able to subscribe to an API plan with a credit card so I can get access immediately without talking to a sales representative.

### Epic 2: Documentation & API Playground

*Goal: Provide a best-in-class experience for learning and testing our APIs.*

6.  **As Alex**, I want to read clear, comprehensive, and searchable documentation for every API endpoint.
7.  **As Alex**, I want to see code examples for requests and responses in multiple programming languages (at least cURL, JavaScript, and Python) so I can copy-paste them directly into my project.
8.  **As Alex**, I want an interactive API playground where I can make live API calls without writing any code so I can quickly test endpoints and understand their behavior.
9.  **As Alex**, I want the playground to be pre-populated with my actual API keys so I don't have to manually copy them in for every test.
10. **As Alex**, I want the playground to provide clear, helpful error messages when a request fails so I can debug issues easily.

### Epic 3: Credential & Security Management

*Goal: Enable developers to manage their API credentials securely and with confidence.*

11. **As Alex**, I want to generate API keys from my developer dashboard so I can authenticate my application.
12. **As Alex**, I want to be able to copy my API keys to the clipboard with a single click.
13. **As Alex**, I want to have multiple API keys for different applications (e.g., one for `staging`, one for `production`) so I can follow security best practices.
14. **As Alex**, I want to be able to rotate (delete and re-create) an API key easily if it gets compromised.
15. **As Alex**, I want to see the last time a key was used so I can identify and delete unused credentials.

### Epic 4: Usage Monitoring & Billing

*Goal: Give developers transparent insight into their API usage and billing.*

16. **As Alex**, I want to see a dashboard with a chart of my API usage over time so I can monitor my application's activity.
17. **As Alex**, I want to receive an email notification when I am approaching my plan's rate limit or quota so I'm not caught by surprise.
18. **As Alex**, I want to view my current subscription plan and billing history so I can manage my account.
19. **As Alex**, I want to be able to upgrade or downgrade my plan easily from the dashboard.
20. **As Alex**, I want to download invoices for my records.

### Epic 5: Team & Security Workflows (Edge Cases)

*Goal: Address the complex, real-world scenarios of team collaboration and security incidents.*

21. **As Alex**, I want to securely invite a new teammate to our shared project or organization so they can access the same APIs and keys.
22. **As Alex**, I want a clear and immediate way to report a compromised or leaked API key so I can begin the remediation process.
23. **As Alex**, upon reporting a leak, I want the system to guide me through rotating the affected key and checking for suspicious activity.
24. **As an Engineering Manager**, I want to see an audit log of all key-related activities for my team so I can maintain oversight.
25. **As Alex, who just joined a team**, I want to easily see which APIs and resources I now have access to via my team's subscription.

### Epic 6: CLI (Command Line Interface) Experience

*Goal: Empower power-users to interact with the FleetEdge API platform directly from their terminal.*

26. **As Alex**, I want to be able to run `fleetedge login` to authenticate the CLI with my developer account.
27. **As Alex**, I want to run `fleetedge apis list` to see the APIs I'm subscribed to.
28. **As Alex**, I want to run `fleetedge keys create` and `fleetedge keys list` to manage my API keys without opening the browser.
29. **As Alex**, I want to run a command like `fleetedge api call vehicles.get --vin=XYZ-123` to make a test API call directly from my terminal.
30. **As Alex**, I want the CLI to have a `--help` command that provides clear documentation on how to use it.
