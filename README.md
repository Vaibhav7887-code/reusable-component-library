# Modern UI Component Library

A showcase of beautiful, reusable UI components with animations and interactions, designed specifically for UX Engineer role applications.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Create modern, responsive UI components with frosted glass design language
- Implement complex animation and interaction patterns using Framer Motion
- Build reusable components with consistent APIs following atomic design principles
- Structure enterprise-grade applications (RBAC system) in a maintainable way
- Balance aesthetics and functionality in UX design with accessibility support
- Develop comprehensive design systems that scale across multiple use cases

## ‚ú® Component Library Features

The library includes the following component categories:

### Buttons
- Multiple variants (default, destructive, outline, etc.)
- Size variations (small, default, large)
- Animation options (pulse, bounce, spin)
- Gradient background options

### Cards
- Different styles and hover effects
- Interactive animation variants
- Consistent design patterns
- Gradient and outline options

### Badges
- Status indicators
- Animation effects
- Gradient options
- Multiple display variants

### Avatars
- Image support with fallbacks
- Size variants 
- Color ring options
- Hover animations

### Inputs
- Multiple style variants
- Focus animations
- Size variations
- Icon support

### Loaders
- Skeleton screens
- Various animation patterns (pulse, shimmer, wave)
- Pre-built composite skeletons
- Customizable sizing

### Notifications
- Toast messages with animations
- Multiple animation patterns
- Status variants
- Interactive dismissal

### RBAC System (Role & Permissions Manager)
- Enterprise-grade access management system
- User management with role-based permissions
- Permission matrix with granular control
- Audit trails and compliance reporting
- Bulk operations and emergency access
- Access drift detection and analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
