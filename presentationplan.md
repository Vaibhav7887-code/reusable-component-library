## **PHASE 2: CASE STUDIES**

# **ACT 1: RBAC & JIT ACCESS CONTROL** (18 minutes)

## **SITUATION** (4 minutes)

### The Core Challenge
**Visual:** Fleet operation diagram showing multiple user types and access needs

"FleetEdge serves two fundamentally different worlds:
1. **Operational Teams:** Fleet managers like Sarah who need simple role assignment
2. **Technical Teams:** Platform engineers like Alex who need programmatic, policy-based access control"

### Research Foundation
**Primary Research Insights:**
- **User Interviews:** 12 interviews across fleet managers, mechanics, and platform engineers
- **Key Finding:** *"When my service fails at 3 AM because of a permissions error, it's not just an inconvenience; it's a potential supply chain disruption."* - Alex (Platform Engineer)
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Three distinct user clusters identified:
  - **Non-Technical Operators (Sarah):** Need simple, template-driven role assignment
  - **Compliance Guardians (Raj):** Require audit trails and bulk governance tools
  - **Technical Platform Engineers (Alex):** Need programmatic control and debugging capabilities

**The "Two Worlds" Problem:**
- **World 1 (Operational):** Sarah assigns a driver to 'Mechanic' role with one click - simple, safe, efficient
- **World 2 (Connected Fleet):** Alex integrates automated load-balancing service - needs programmatic access, not UI clicks
- **Current Pain:** When Alex's service fails at 3 AM, it's not just inconvenience—it's supply chain disruption

**Competitive Analysis:**
- Traditional IAM solutions too complex for fleet operations
- Fleet-specific tools too simplistic for technical teams
- **Opportunity:** First fleet-focused platform with enterprise-grade IAM that speaks the language of vehicles, drivers, and routes

## **TASK** (3 minutes)

### Problem Definition
**Core Challenge:** Design an access control system that serves both technical and non-technical users without compromising security or usability.

**Specific Problems to Solve:**
1. **Black Box Debugging:** Generic error messages lead to hours of troubleshooting
2. **Over-privileging:** Permanent access grants create security risks
3. **Manual Processes:** Policy changes require IT tickets and delays
4. **Context Loss:** No connection between business events and access needs

### Success Metrics Defined
- Reduce permission-related support tickets by 60%
- Enable self-service policy creation for 80% of use cases
- Implement zero-downtime access rotation
- Achieve sub-10-second policy evaluation response time

## **ACTION** (8 minutes)

### Design Process & Methodology

#### 1. **User Research & Persona Development**
**Show:** Four-persona ecosystem chart
- **Sarah (Fleet Operations Leader):** Manages 500+ users, needs confidence that access decisions won't create problems
- **Alex (Platform Engineer):** Technical oversight, needs programmatic control and debugging tools
- **Raj (IT/Compliance Manager):** Audit trails and bulk governance, reports to CISO
- **Maya (Product Operations):** Ensures users can do jobs effectively, bridges business and tech
- **Design Insight:** Same system, progressive disclosure for different expertise levels

#### 2. **Journey Mapping & Pain Point Analysis**
**Visual:** Current state journey map highlighting friction points
- **Key Friction:** "Access Denied" → 2-hour debugging process
- **Root Cause:** No visibility into policy evaluation logic

#### 3. **Design Principles Established**
**Show principles with visual examples:**
- **Dual Interface Strategy:** Simple for operators, powerful for developers
- **Debuggable by Design:** Every denial includes actionable trace
- **Fleet-Context Aware:** Policies understand vehicles, routes, maintenance

#### 4. **Component Design & System Architecture**

**Feature 1: The Auth Sandbox (Vehicle & Service Simulator)**
**Visual:** Three-panel interface mockup
- **Left Panel:** Actor selection (Users, Services, Tokens)
- **Center Panel:** Action and resource definition
- **Right Panel:** Interactive evaluation trace

**Design Decisions:**
- Fleet-specific actors: `Dispatcher: Priya Gupta`, `Service: RouteOptimization-v3`
- Real fleet resources: `Vehicle (VIN: FE-459-TKR)`, `MaintenanceLog (ID: 99812)`
- Actionable traces: *"Policy 'MechanicGeofence' denied because vehicle.location ('Depot B') ≠ required ('Maintenance Bay A')"*

**Feature 2: Visual Policy Builder (Fleet Policy Architect)**
**Visual:** Mad Libs-style interface
- **Template Example:** `Allow [Service: InsurancePartnerAPI] to [read:telemetry] on [Vehicle] IF [Vehicle.InsurancePolicyID] EQUALS [InsurancePartnerAPI.PolicyID]`
- **Fleet-Specific Templates:** Emergency Override, Partner Logistics Access, Maintenance Bay Restrictions

**Feature 3: JIT Access with Event-Driven Triggers (The "Wow" Feature)**
**Visual:** Live Fleet Events panel → Context-Aware Access Modal → Audit Timeline
- **The Problem:** Granting permanent access is over-privileging, manual requests are slow in emergencies
- **The Innovation:** Access as temporary response to real-world fleet events
- **Scenario Flow:**
  1. Critical brake failure alert for active route vehicle
  2. System presents pre-configured mechanic access request
  3. Manager approves with one click (reduced cognitive load)
  4. Access auto-expires after 2 hours (automatic security)
  5. Clear audit story: *"2-hour temporary brake system access granted TO RESPOND TO brake failure event"*
- **Fleet Context:** This moves from reactive security to proactive, autonomous fleet operation

**Component Architecture Highlight:**
- **Reusable Atoms:** `PermissionToggle`, `RoleIndicator`, `RiskBadge`, `StatusDot`
- **Smart Molecules:** `UserCard`, `PermissionGroup`, `RoleSelector`, `BulkActionBar`
- **Complex Organisms:** `UserTable`, `UserEditDrawer`, `AccessDriftAnalyzer`, `BreakGlassPanel`
- **Design System Integration:** 80% reuse of existing components, 20% RBAC-specific extensions

#### 5. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
**Show:** Stakeholder alignment workshop outcomes
- **Security Team:** Validated policy-as-code approach meets compliance needs
- **DevOps Team:** Confirmed GitOps integration requirements
- **Fleet Operations:** Approved simplified UI for daily use

### Technical Implementation Highlights
**Architecture Decisions:**
- Policy evaluation engine: 10ms response time requirement
- Audit trail: Immutable event sourcing pattern
- CI/CD Integration: Policy changes trigger automated PR creation

## **RESULT** (3 minutes)

#### Primary Research Phase
**Method:** 5 developer interviews + 30-person survey across integration partners
**Key Personas Validated:**
- **Alex (Senior Developer):** Values speed, autonomy, clear documentation
- **Priya (Junior Developer):** Needs guided experience, copy-paste examples

**Three Developer Behavioral Patterns Identified:**
1. **CLI-First Power Users (Alex):** Skip UI entirely, measure platform quality by CLI sophistication
2. **Docs-First Explorers (Priya):** Start with Google, build trust through documentation clarity
3. **UI-First Visual Learners:** Navigate web interface to build mental model before coding

#### Critical Pain Points Identified
**Research Insight #1:** *"Trust is earned in the first 5 minutes, or lost forever"*
- 70% of first API calls to new platforms fail
- Poor initial experience leads to immediate abandonment

**Research Insight #2:** *"Developers fear the black box"*
- Generic error messages (`400 Bad Request`) create hours of trial-and-error
- Need actionable, specific error guidance

**Research Insight #3:** *"Security is shared responsibility"*
- Developers want to follow best practices but need tools
- Key rotation anxiety prevents proper security hygiene

#### Journey Mapping & Friction Analysis
**Visual:** Current state developer journey with specific friction costs
- **Discovery:** Hard to find developer resources → 40% immediate abandonment
- **Onboarding:** Manual email process takes 2-3 days → 25% drop-off during wait
- **Integration:** First API call failure with cryptic errors → 70% of first calls fail
- **Maintenance:** Fear of rotating production keys → Developers avoid security best practices

**High-Impact Friction Points (From Research):**
1. **"API keys take too long to get"** → Instant self-service generation with scoped UI
2. **"I'm afraid to rotate a production key"** → Grace period rotation flow prevents downtime
3. **"Generic error messages are useless"** → Actionable errors with suggested next steps
4. **"I can't test before committing/paying"** → Public interactive playground with examples

## **ACTION** (7 minutes)

### Design Process & Strategic Decisions

#### 1. **Stakeholder Alignment & Vision Setting**
**Workshop Outcomes:**
- **Product Strategy:** API-first approach with UI as one interface
- **Business Model:** Freemium with usage-based pricing tiers
- **Success Metrics:** Time-to-first-call, developer NPS, API adoption rate

#### 2. **Information Architecture & System Design**
**Visual:** Entity relationship diagram
- **Organizations** have **Users** who create **API Keys** with **Scopes**
- **API Products** have **Subscriptions** that generate **Usage Logs**
- **Separation of Concerns:** User permissions vs. API key scopes

#### 3. **Core UX Principles Established**
- **Self-Service by Default:** Zero human intervention required
- **Speed to "Aha!":** < 5 minutes from discovery to successful API call
- **Build Trust:** Through transparency, security, and reliability signals

#### 4. **Feature Design & Component Architecture**

**Feature 1: API Marketplace**
**Visual:** Card-based marketplace interface
- **Design Decision:** Cards over tables for quick scanning and comparison
- **Content Strategy:** High-level overviews, not detailed docs on marketplace
- **Filtering:** By product type, access level, pricing tier

**Feature 2: Interactive API Playground**
**Visual:** Three-panel interface (Postman-inspired)
- **Left:** Endpoint navigation tree
- **Center:** Request builder with parameter inputs

- **Security Features:** Scoped keys, TTL options, rotation with grace periods

**Feature 4: CLI Experience (The Power User Layer)**
**Visual:** Terminal interface examples
- **Philosophy:** First-class composable interface, not UI parity
- **Key Commands:** `fleetedge login`, `keys create`, `api call`, `usage`
- **Error Recovery:** CLI errors include direct portal URLs for resolution
- **CLI-to-PR Workflow:** `fleetedge keys rotate --create-pr` automatically opens GitHub PR

**Innovation Highlight: CLI-to-Web Bridge**
- **Problem:** CLI errors traditionally dump cryptic messages
- **Solution:** CLI provides clickable URLs that deep-link to relevant portal pages
- **Example:** `Error: Insufficient scope. View details: https://portal.fleetedge.com/keys/fe_sk_...xxxx/scopes`

#### 5. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
**Stakeholder Coordination:**
- **Security Team:** Validated key rotation and scoping approach
- **Developer Relations:** Co-created documentation and tutorials
- **Engineering:** Aligned on API design and rate limiting strategy
- **Sales:** Incorporated demo requirements and pricing feedback

### Design Iterations & Real-World Failures

#### Challenge: Dynamic Playground Complexity
**Initial Vision:** Fully dynamic playground for any API schema
**Reality Check:** Engineering estimated 2-month delay
**Compromise:** Templated playground for top 3 APIs first
**Rationale:** Speed to market more valuable than perfect solution
**Result:** Delivered 80% of value in 20% of time - validated approach

#### Challenge: Security vs. Convenience Balance
**Conflict:** Security wanted 30-day key expiration, DevRel wanted flexibility
**Cross-Team Workshop Outcome:** Multi-faceted solution satisfying both:
- Smart defaults (90 days) with override capability
- Proactive alerting (14 and 3 days before expiration)
- One-click renewal flow from alert emails
- **Impact:** Reduced security vs. usability tension, became model for other features

#### Design Failure & Recovery: "Try-It-Now" Token Expiration
**What We Missed:** Users returning after 24-hour trial token expiration got cryptic 401 errors
**User Impact:** Broken playground experience for returning users
**Quick Fix:** Implemented "token expired" state with clear upgrade path
**Learning:** Design for user lifecycle, not just happy path

---

## **Q&A PREPARATION** (3 minutes)

### Anticipated Questions & Responses

**Q: "How do you balance security requirements with user experience?"**
**A:** "I don't see them as competing priorities. In identity management, good UX IS good security. The key rotation flow with grace periods is more secure than the previous manual process because it encourages best practices. When secure actions are easier than insecure ones, users naturally make better choices. The CLI-to-PR workflow is another example - it makes the secure path (peer review) the default path."

**Q: "How do you measure the success of identity and developer experience design?"**
**A:** "I focus on leading indicators of trust and adoption: time-to-first-success, error recovery rates, and user confidence metrics. For these projects, the most important metric was reducing the time from 'access denied' to 'problem solved' - that's where user trust is won or lost. We tracked 'Time to First Successful API Call' as our north star metric."

**Q: "How would you approach similar challenges at Okta's scale?"**
**A:** "The principles scale - research-driven design, progressive disclosure of complexity, and making secure paths easy. At Okta's scale, I'd focus even more on reusable design systems and cross-product consistency. The component library and design tokens approach I used at FleetEdge would be even more critical in a larger, more complex product ecosystem."

**Q: "What would you do differently or what didn't work as expected?"**
**A:** "The biggest learning was designing for the user lifecycle, not just the happy path. Our 'try-it-now' token expiration failure taught me to always consider returning users. Also, I initially underestimated the importance of CLI-to-web bridges - developers really do want to move fluidly between command line and visual interfaces. In retrospect, I would have prioritized that integration earlier."

**Q: "How do you handle technical debt in design decisions?"**
**A:** "I treat design debt the same as technical debt - it's an investment tradeoff. The templated playground vs. fully dynamic playground was a conscious choice to deliver value quickly. We documented the limitation, measured its impact, and planned to address it in a future iteration. The key is being transparent about the tradeoffs and having a plan to address them."

### Closing Statement
"This work demonstrates my approach to product design: start with deep user understanding, think in systems and platforms rather than features, and measure success by the trust and capability you give users. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring this strategic, research-driven approach to Okta's mission of enabling secure identity for everyone."
