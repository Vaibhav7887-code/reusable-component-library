44.  These assess your understanding of developer platforms, identity, and extensibility â€” from their current roadmap.

45. ðŸ“Œ Identity Platform Product Design
46.  "How do you balance usability and security when designing authentication experiences?"

47.  (They're checking if you grasp tradeoffs like session persistence vs. forced logout, friction vs. trust, etc.)

48.  "What do you consider the most frustrating part of developer onboarding for identity APIs, and how would you improve it?"

49.  (They want to see if youâ€™ve used or thought deeply about Auth0/Okta's own flows â€” not just your own.)

50.  "How would you design for extensibility across SDKs, CLI, and APIs in a unified identity platform?"

51.  (Theyâ€™re testing your multi-surface design thinking â€” CLI, web, API, docs â€” like what your prototype touches on.)

52.  "Whatâ€™s your approach to reducing â€˜time to first authâ€™ in a developer integration journey?"

53.  (Core Auth0 metric â€” this is a must-win question. They want activation acceleration strategy.)

54.  "How would you handle role conflicts or privilege escalation risks in a low-code/no-code permission editor?"

59. ðŸ“Œ RBAC System
60.  "You included 'View as User' in your RBAC UI. How do you ensure that it doesnâ€™t create a security risk itself?"

61.  "Tell me how you'd support thousands of users and roles in this interface â€” have you thought about scale, latency, or filtering?"
